- 👋 Hi, I’m CryanAngel at @furinkazan-web
- 👀 I’m interested in French language so I name my functions in French
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and PHP
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making apps for local businesses and big projects if it is interesting
- 📫 I'm new on Github and don't exactly know how it works so I'll complete later.
